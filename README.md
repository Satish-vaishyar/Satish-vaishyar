## <a name="about"></a>About Me

I’m an **AI/ML Engineer** with a strong interest in building **research-backed, production-oriented machine learning systems**.

My work spans the full lifecycle of ML development: data preparation, feature engineering, model design, training, evaluation, and deployment-ready pipelines. I enjoy working at the intersection of **theory and execution**, where ideas are validated through experiments and translated into usable systems.

I actively explore modern AI approaches such as **Transformers, Large Language Models (LLMs), retrieval-based architectures, and multi-agent workflows**, with a focus on clarity, reproducibility, and real-world relevance.



## <a name="journey"></a>My Professional Journey

I started my journey by learning the fundamentals of **machine learning and deep learning**, gradually moving from classical models to neural networks and transformer-based architectures.

Over time, my focus shifted toward:
- Building **end-to-end ML pipelines** rather than isolated models  
- Understanding how design decisions affect scalability and performance  
- Exploring **research-driven problems**, leading to peer-reviewed publications  
- Applying AI concepts in fast-paced environments like **national-level hackathons**

Alongside hands-on development, I’ve co-authored multiple research papers published in **IEEE and Springer venues**, gaining experience in structured experimentation, peer review, and presenting technical work at international forums.

Today, I position myself as someone who can **design, implement, and reason about AI systems**, not just train models.

## <a name="research--publications"></a>Research & Publications

I have **three peer-reviewed research publications**, focusing on applied machine learning and deep learning system design.

1. **A Transformer-Based Approach for DDoS Attacks Detection in SDN with Optimized Feature Selection**  
   IEEE Xplore  
   https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11300566

2. **DDoS Attacks Detection in SDN Using Multi-feature Selection Approach and LLMs**  
   IEEE Xplore  
   https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-032-04312-2_7

3. **PassPhrase Authentication: A Secure and User-Friendly Multi-factor Authentication System Using Phrase and Gesture Integration**  
   Springer  
   https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-032-04312-2_8

These experiences strengthened my ability to think critically about models, datasets, evaluation metrics, and experimental design.
